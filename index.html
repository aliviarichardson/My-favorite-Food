            <h2>Why I Love <i>Alfredo</i></h2>
            <p>
                Alfredo is my <b>absolute favorite</b> comfort food. The 
                <mark>creamy garlic sauce</mark> mixed with pasta is so rich and 
                satisfying that it always makes me feel warm and relaxed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember the first time I had Alfredo on 
                <time datetime="2018-06-10">June 10, 2018</time>. 
                Since then, it has become my go-to meal whenever I want something 
                delicious that feels like a hug in a bowl.

            <h2>Scrolling Alfredo (Deprecated Feature Example)</h2>
            <p>
                The image below is inside a <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag, which is a 
                <strong>deprecated</strong> HTML element that was once used to make text or 
                images scroll across the screen. Today, developers would usually use CSS animations 
                instead, but I am using it here for this assignment.

            <h2>How Alfredo Makes Me Feel</h2>
            <p>
                I would describe Alfredo like this:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <q>Alfredo is comfort food at its finest, cozy and creamy after a long day.</q>
            </blockquote>
